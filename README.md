# Uppsala
CoNLL 2017 Shared Task Team Uppsala

The Uppsala submission to the CoNLL 2017 shared task has two components:
* a joint sentence segmenter and tokenizer
* a transition-based parser

The parsing code has been released [here](http://github.com/UppsalaNLP/uuparser).

The tokenization code will be released soon and we are planning to add the scripts needed to run the pipeline in this repository.

You can read more about our system in this paper:
